        <h2>Australian dessert with a meringue base, topped with fresh cream and fruit. This is a recipe that I have experimented with and all my friends and family say it's the best pavlova they've ever tasted!</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 egg whites</li>
                    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                    <li>1 pint fresh strawberries </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice.</li>
                    <li>Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/4 inch thick. With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 1 hour. Turn off oven, but leave meringue in oven for an additional 30 minutes. When cool, the meringue should be hard on the outside, and slightly moist on the inside.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.</li>
                </ol>
