        <img src="/images/brownie.jpg" alt="A delicious brownie">
        <h2>This is a recipe I've developed after numerous iterations, trying to preserve everything that makes brownies delicious: the cakey bottom, the fudgy center, and the crunchy sugary film at the top. Hope you enjoy making it for yourself and sharing with friends and family! If you end up eating it all yourself, that is.</h2>
